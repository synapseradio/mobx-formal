# formalized

A small library to make form handling easier for applications using MobX for state management. It is meant to simplify the process of form creation, management, validation and providing useful feedback to users,  

formalized has no dependencies on React, so you can use it with any view layer. 

formalized uses [validator.js](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js) to provide some of the most common form validation rules. However, it also gives you the ability to easily create your own validation rules
## How it works
